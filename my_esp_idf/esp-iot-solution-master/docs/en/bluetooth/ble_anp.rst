Alert Notification Profile
==============================
:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

The Alert Notification profile allows a device like a watch to obtain information from a
cellphone about incoming calls, missed calls and SMS/MMS messages. The information
may include the caller ID for an incoming call or the sender’s ID for email/SMS/MMS but
not the message. This profile also enables the client device to get information about the
number of unread messages on the server device.
