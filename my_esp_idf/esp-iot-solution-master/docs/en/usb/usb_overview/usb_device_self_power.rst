According to the USB protocol requirements, self-powered USB devices must detect the 5V VBUS voltage to determine if the device is unplugged, thereby enabling hot-plugging. For host-powered devices, since the device shuts down immediately when the host VBUS is disconnected, there is no need to implement this logic.

There are generally two methods for USB device VBUS detection: detection by USB PHY hardware, or \ **detection by software with the help of ADC/GPIO**\.

The internal USB PHY of ESP32S2/S3 does not support hardware detection logic, this function needs to be implemented by software with the help of ADC/GPIO. Among them, using the GPIO detection method is the simplest. The implementation is as follows:

**For ESP-IDF 4.4 and earlier versions:**


#. On the hardware side, you need to allocate an additional I/O (except for special pins) connected to ESP32S2/S3 through a voltage divider with two resistors (e.g., two 100KΩ). (Note: ESP32S2/S3 I/O maximum input voltage is 3.3v.)
#. After the ``tinyusb_driver_install``, it is necessary to call the ``usbd_vbus_detect_gpio_enable`` function to enable VBUS detection. The implementation code for this function is as follows. Please copy it to the required location for invocation:

**For ESP-IDF 5.0 and later versions:**

#. Same as above, the hardware needs to occupy an additional IO (arbitrarily specified, except for special pins), which is connected to ESP32S2/S3 through two resistor voltage dividers (for example, two 100KΩ);
#. Initialize the IO used to detect VBUS to GPIO input mode;
#. Configure IO directly into ``tinyusb_config_t`` (\ `For details, please refer to <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/api-reference/peripherals/usb_device. html#self-powered-device>`_\ ):
