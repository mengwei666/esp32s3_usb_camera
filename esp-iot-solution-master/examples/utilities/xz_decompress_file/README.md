# XZ Decompress Example

This example demonstrates how to use function `xz_decompress()` to decompress the specified file.
The `xz_decompress()` is based on the `XZ Embedded` library, for more information about `XZ Embedded`, please refer to [XZ Embeded](https://tukaani.org/xz/embedded.html).

### Generate the Compressed File

> Note:
> Please install **xz** tool based on your operation system, this part will not be described here, please google it if needed.

To compress the specified file, use the following command:

```shell
xz --check=crc32 --lzma2=dict=8KiB -k file_name
```

Use `xz -h` to get more information about how to use `xz` command to compress the specified file.

In this example, we use the following command to compress `test_file/hello.txt`:

```
xz --check=crc32 --lzma2=dict=8KiB -k test_file/hello.txt
```

### Build and flash

To run the example, type the following command:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)
