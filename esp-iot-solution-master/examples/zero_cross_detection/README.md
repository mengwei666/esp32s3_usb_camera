# Example: Zero_Cross_Detection

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

This routine demonstrates the detection and analysis of zero-crossing signals, as well as the control of relays.

## GPIO functions:

| GPIO                         | Direction | Configuration                                          |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| CONFIG_GPIO_OUTPUT_5         | output    | control the relay                                      |
| CONFIG_GPIO_INPUT_2          | input     | pulled up, interrupt from rising edge and falling edge |

## How to use example

Before project configuration and build, be sure to set the correct chip target using `idf.py set-target <chip_name>`.

### Hardware Required

* A development board with any Espressif SoC (e.g., ESP32-DevKitC, ESP-WROVER-KIT, etc.)
* A USB cable for Power supply and programming
* Some jumper wires to connect GPIOs.
* Zero cross singal Source

### Configure the project

Before compiling the project, configure it using `idf.py menuconfig`

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run the monitor tool to view the serial output:

Run `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
